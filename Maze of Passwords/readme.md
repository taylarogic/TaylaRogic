[Maze of Passwords](https://taylarogic.github.io/codeWords/12/metahaven) is a project coded in Processing. The parallels between the illegibility of metal logos and the encryptions found in CAPTCHAS and barcodes made for an interesting commentary that drew me towards Metahaven’s text. I took this chance to explore ideas of passwords and trademarks, whereby one is publicly communicated and the other is not. My concept was to create a maze out of words, akin to the intricate, asymmetrical maze-like logos. The jagged, strings of text pay homage to metals visual aesthetic, as well as symbolise the world of visual trademarks that are dissimilar to black metals private appearance. My primary concept was to depict this idea of unclear communication that is prevalent in the logos. This theory of illegibility as code corresponds with the chaos and disruption that exists within the project and the feeling of having to decode to understand a message. is a project coded in Processing.
